# Instagram Reach Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze Instagram engagement data to identify trends and patterns, determine which engagement factors drive the highest impressions, and develop a predictive model to forecast reach. This analysis provides actionable insights for optimizing Instagram content performance and enhancing user engagement.

## Data Source
The dataset includes detailed Instagram engagement metrics, such as likes, shares, comments, and profile visits, along with post impressions, hashtags, and captions.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Standardized data formats for analysis and modeling.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed descriptive analysis on key metrics such as the number of unique hashtags and captions.
- Created visualizations to analyze data distributions and correlations between variables.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new features such as:
  - **Engagement Rate**: (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Impressions
  - **Conversion Rate**: Follows / Profile Visits

### 4. Trend Analysis
- Analyzed reach trends over time using line plots.
- Examined the sources of impressions (e.g., home feed, hashtags, explore) to determine their contribution.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Applied linear regression to predict impressions based on engagement metrics.
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as R-squared score.
  
## Impact
This project provides key insights into Instagram engagement, helping content creators and marketers optimize their strategies. The predictive model enables accurate forecasting of post reach, guiding decision-making in content creation for maximum visibility.
